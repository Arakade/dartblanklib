# dartblanklib
## A starting spot for a dart library.

### Why?
> As I was building [dartlib](https://github.com/kevmoo/dartlib) I realized there were few other examples of dart libraries. I was making up conventions (directory names, etc) as I went along based on my experience with *Ruby/Gems* and *node.js* among others.

### Structure

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>readme.md</td>
    <td>
      All projects should have one. `md` means <a href='http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/'>Markdown</a> which github parses nicely.
      <em>Although &lt;table&gt; support is not ideal.</em>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pubspec</td>
    <td>...todo...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>test/</td>
    <td>...todo...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>vendor/</td>
    <td>...todo...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>samples/</td>
    <td>...todo...</td>
  </tr>
</table>
